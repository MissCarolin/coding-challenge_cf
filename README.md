If I had more time, I would have worked on the following:


- Try to get the next course dates properly displayed and therefore get the javaScript promise function, especially the chained API call, working

- Get the api call working (like above) and figure out the condition how to display the correct currency

- Change the typo of the fonts

- Change one card to a different color

- Optimise the page for an iPad size

- Find a better solution to place the image in the header then "position: absolute" 

- Create a navbar

- Create a footer
